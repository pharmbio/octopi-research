class ComponentLabel(str,Enum):
    LIVE_BUTTON_IDLE_TEXT="Start Live"
    LIVE_BUTTON_RUNNING_TEXT="Stop Live"
    LIVE_BUTTON_TOOLTIP="""
Start/Stop live image view

Records images multiple times per second, up to the specified maximum FPS (to the right).

Useful for manual investigation of a plate and/or imaging settings.

Note that this can lead to strong photobleaching. Consider using the Snap button instead.
    """
    BTN_SNAP_LABEL="Snap"
    BTN_SNAP_TOOLTIP="""
Take a single image in the selected channel.

The image will not be saved, just displayed.
"""
    BTN_SNAP_ALL_LABEL="Snap selection"
    BTN_SNAP_ALL_TOOLTIP="""
Take one image in the selected channels and display them in the multi-point acqusition panel.

The images will not be saved.

    BTN_SNAP_ALL_CHANNEL_SELECT_LABEL="Change selection"
    BTN_SNAP_ALL_CHANNEL_SELECT_TOOLTIP="""
Change selection of channels imaged on 'snap selection'

By default, 'snap selection' will acquire an image in every channel present on the microscope, including all fluroescence and brightfield channels.

This button opens up a window where you can indicate which channels should (not) be imaged by the 'snap selection' button.

Note: The selection is preserved as long as the program is open, so make sure the selection is set as expected before using 'snap selection'.
"""
    BTN_SNAP_ALL_OFFSET_CHECKBOX_LABEL="Apply z offset"
    BTN_SNAP_ALL_OFFSET_CHECKBOX_TOOLTIP="""
Apply z offset to snap selection

This button indicates use of the Laser AF system for 'snap selection'.
Accordingly, this functionality is only available when the Laser AF system is initialized.

The 'snap selection' button does not move the objective in z when this box is unchecked, which notably excludes any use of the Laser AF system.
If this box is checked, each image in the 'snap selection' mode is acquired after the objective has moved to <focus plane height> + <channel offset>.

Note: This box only impacts the snap selection functionality. 
      e.g. to enable the Laser AF system for regular image acqusition, the checkbox is elsewhere.
    """

    EXPOSURE_TIME_LABEL="Exposure time:"
    EXPOSURE_TIME_TOOLTIP="""
Exposure time in ms.

The exposure time is the duration for which the camera sensor records a single image.

Higher exposure time means more time to record light emitted from a sample, which also increases bleaching (the light source is activate as long as the camera sensor records the light).

Range is 0.01ms to 968.0ms
    """
    ANALOG_GAIN_LABEL="Analog gain:"
    ANALOG_GAIN_TOOLTIP="""
Analog gain increases the camera sensor sensitiviy.

Higher gain will make the image look brighter so that a lower exposure time can be used, but also introduces more noise.

Note that a value of zero means that a (visible) will still be recorded.

Range is 0.0 to 24.0
    """
    CHANNEL_OFFSET_LABEL="Z Offset:"
    CHANNEL_OFFSET_TOOLTIP="""
Z offset in Âµm.

Channel/Light source specific Z offset used in multipoint acquisition.

Can be used to focus on cell organelles in different Z planes."""
    ILLUMINATION_LABEL="Illumination:"
    ILLUMINATION_TOOLTIP="""
Illumination %.

Fraction of laser power used for illumination of the sample.

Similar effect as exposure time, e.g. the signal is about the same at 50% illumination as it is at half the exposure time.

Range is 0.1 - 100.0 %.
    """
    CAMERA_PIXEL_FORMAT_TOOLTIP="""
Camera pixel format

Mono8 means monochrome (grey-scale) 8bit
Mono12 means monochrome 12bit

More bits can capture more detail (8bit can capture 2^8 intensity values, 12bit can capture 2^12), but also increase file size.
Due to file format restrictions, Mono12 takes up twice the storage of Mono8 (not the expected 50%).
    """

    FPS_TOOLTIP="""
Maximum number of frames per second that are recorded while live.

The actual number of recorded frames per second may be smaller because of the exposure time, e.g. 5 images with 300ms exposure time each don't fit into a single second.
    """

    BTN_LOAD_CONFIG_TOOLTIP="load settings related to all imaging modes/channels from a file (this will open a window where you will specify the file to load)"
    CONFIG_FILE_LAST_PATH_LABEL="config. file:"
    CONFIG_FILE_LAST_PATH_TOOLTIP="""
Configuration file that was loaded last.

If no file has been manually loaded, this will show the path to the default configuration file where the currently displayed settings are always saved.
If a file has been manually loaded at some point, the last file that was loaded will be displayed.

An asterisk (*) will be displayed after the filename if the settings have been changed since a file has been loaded.

These settings are continuously saved into the default configuration file and restored when the program is started up again, they do NOT automatically overwrite the last configuration file that was loaded.
